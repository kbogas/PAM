# PAM
Prime Adjacency Matrix for Multi-relational Networks

Accompanying code for ICDM_2022 submission.

Data are expected to be downloaded in a folder name data, here on the top-level folder.

The datasets used can be downloaded all in one  from [here](https://owncloud.skel.iit.demokritos.gr/index.php/s/F8SVcNxq9KXyt6d).
(The ogb-wikikg2 dataset will be downloaded separately using the ogb handler as expected).


The *utils.py* and *grakel_utils.py* files, contain functionality code to support the proposed framework and facilitate the experiments.

The rest of the files are used to reproduce the results present in the article:
- The *scalability_test.py* reproduces the usability results presented in III.A.
- The *graph_classification_with_gridsearch.py* reproduces the graph-kerenl comparison results presented in III.C.
- The *Hetionet_Metapaths_Extraction.ipynb* notebook presents the related results to metapath-extraction.


This will be updated regularly.
